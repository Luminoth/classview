This is a mini-list of things that need to be done to get classView ready to go. A more complete list can be found by tacking on every FIXME and TODO in the code onto this list.

----------

4 Functionize the code more

7 Fix threading of openEditor
    right now if threading is used, a lot of seg faults occur
    I'm not sure where it's occuring, however.

9 Cleanup Parser code

11 General code cleanup

13 clean up includes

14 enable/disable close menu option (code is partially there, it just doesn't work)

15 verify tags file in Parser code

16 comment code

17 use autoconf and automake

21 Finish Win32 port

22 Run ctags in other directories?

23 detect resize events to save window size (IMPORTANT!)

24 the whole FileSystem class is a mess, it needs to be more elegant

25 honestly, the entire Parser class needs re-writing... it's just bad...
